# -Recommendation-System
This project demonstrates the use of collaborative filtering to create a recommendation system. Collaborative filtering is a technique used in recommendation systems where users' past behaviors and preferences are analyzed to recommend items (e.g., movies, books, products) they might like. This system uses user-item interactions, such as ratings, to predict and recommend new items for a user.
